React + Vite
Greeting Cards Application
A React application built using Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS to practice creating components and passing props. The application displays a header and three greeting cards, each with a title and message, demonstrating component structure, prop passing, and styling with Tailwind CSS.

Project Overview
This project involves creating a simple "Greeting Cards" app using React and Vite. The primary objectives were to:
Set up a React application with Vite.
Create functional components and pass props to display dynamic content.
Style components effectively using Tailwind CSS.
By working through this project, I gained hands-on experience in React, including component creation, prop management, and styling. I also learned how to set up a React project with Vite and Tailwind CSS, streamlining the development process and improving performance.

Testing Screenshots
Below is a screenshot showing the final output of the Greeting Cards application, including the header and the three greeting cards displayed correctly:

Discussion
Working on this project was a great way to solidify my understanding of React components and how to use props for passing dynamic data. Setting up the application with Vite was quick and efficient, and Tailwind CSS made it easy to apply consistent styling across components.

I found it particularly helpful to focus on breaking the app into small, reusable components. This approach not only made the code easier to manage but also enhanced my understanding of React’s component-driven architecture.

Technologies Used:
React – JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Vite – Fast build tool for modern web projects
Tailwind CSS – Utility-first CSS framework for styling
